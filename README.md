# Meyer's Movies Database API

myFlix is a REST API that interacts with a MongoDB database of movies. This API is used in two of my other projects, which use both [React](https://github.com/s-c-meyer/myFlix-client) and [Angular](https://github.com/s-c-meyer/myFlix-Angular-client). The API was tested using Postman and is deployed to Heroku. 

## Features of the API

### GET 
- Return a list of all movies to the user
- Return all data about a specific movie to the user
- Return data about a specific genre, including the genre's name and description
- Return data about a specific director, including the director's name, biography, and birth year

### PUT

### POST

### DELETE
